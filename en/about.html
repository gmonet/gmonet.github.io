<h2>Skills</h2>
<div>
<h4> Cross-disciplinary science and technology </h2>
    <p>Scientific writing, scientific monitoring, written and oral communication, <span data-tooltip="During my thesis, I gave lectures to engineering students (L3) of Polytech Paris-Sud. The teaching consisted in a review of general physics (mechanics, optics, electromagnetism). I also supervised some optics TP for M1 students at Orsay">teaching</span>.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
<h4> Experimental science </h2>
    <p><span data-tooltip="I have performed X-ray scattering experiments at the LPS (Orsay) in the MATRIX group on medium and wide angle diffractometers. I also participated to X-ray scattering experiments on the D2AM light line of the ESRF synchrotron (Grenoble).">X-ray scattering</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="During my thesis, I worked on several inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the IN1, IN4 and IN16b lines of the ILL (Grenoble). I analyzed all the data with the Mantid software.">inelastic neutron scattering</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="During my thesis, I performed a X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at K-edge aluminum on the LUCIA light line at the SOLEIL synchrotron. I created a Python program to analyze automatically and in parallel about 300 XANES spectra in order to extract the coordination of aluminum atoms during a temperature heating.">X-ray absorption</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip=" During my thesis, I performed an infrared spectroscopy experiment on the B22 line (Diamond). I also collaborated in a measurement project at the Charles Coulomb Laboratory.">infrared spectroscopy</span>, RMN spectrescopy, Raman spectrescopy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4> Numerical competence </h2>
    <p>
    <span data-tooltip="Advanced level - I use Python regularly to perform high performance scientific computations with the libraries numpy, scipy, numba and the hybrid programming language Cython. I have also gained a lot of experience with the visualization libraries bokeh and plotly but especially matplotlib. I use daily the Pandas library for the management of my simulations or experiments results. I have developed a high performance and flexible Brownian dynamics simulation library running on a graphics card (<a href='https://github.com/gmonet/brownpy'>ee repo in GitHub</a>).">Python</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - I followed Stéphane Mallat's course at Collège de France and MOOCs on Keras and Tensorflow. I have also taken the 1 day course 'Deep learning for healthcare image analysis' from Nvidia offered by the SCAI of the Sorbonne University. I would like to learn more about it.">Machine Learning</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate/Advanced level - I simulate the dynamics of nanoconfined water molecules (with or without the presence of electrolytes) using GROMACS or LAMMPS software. I also learned to use MDAnalysis, a Python library, to analyze trajectories.">Molecular dynamics</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate level - C is the first programming language I studied and used. I followed some courses during my education. During these courses, I realized a chess game with a graphical interface. I was then able to apply these concepts during my internship at the CSNSM where I created a graphical interface for an access to a database on the properties of excited nuclei. Finally, later, I used this language for personal projects with the Unreal Engine 4.">C/C++</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - During my year of study at the Engineering School, I learned to use Matlab for image processing and to perform hydrodynamics simulation.">Matlab</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Niveau intermédiaire - J'ai utilisé Mathematica pour m'assister dans le développement d'un modèle théorique concernant les propriétés diélectriques l'eau confinée.">Mathematica</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate level - During my thesis, I learned about Git to set up a versioning system for my thesis manuscript, scientific papers and Python programs. I got familiar with the commit system, branching, merging, publishing on GitHub and LFS.">Git</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate level - I am not a Linux enthusiast but I learned to become accustomed to this operating system during my master classes, my internship at CERN but especially during my post-doc. Today, I work on Linux machines remotely using SSH and VSCode. I also occasionally work on Linux via WSL">Linux</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - Adobe Illustrator is a program that I use mainly to retouch and concatenate figures in pdf format.">Adobe Illustrator</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Advanced level - I use Word and PowerPoint daily with advanced features such as the style system. For example, I had started writing my thesis manuscript with Word but switched from it to LaTeX because of the lack of support for vector images.">Office</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Advanced - I used LaTeX to write my thesis manuscript and now I write my scientific papers with Overleaf.">LaTeX</span>, 
    Zotero, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate level - I've always enjoyed imagining and designing user interfaces. My most significant project, based on Python, is an X-ray scattering simulation software.">Qt</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Intermediate/Advanced level - Blender is a 3D modeling software that I have always enjoyed. I started using it in high school and have continued to use it regularly until today. During my thesis, I developed an extension to display and manipulate trajectories of molecular dynamics.">Blender</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - I've always been attracted to video game development. I worked on strategy game projects which allowed me to familiarize myself with these two video game engines as well as with the C, C++ and C# languages.">Unreal Engine 4, Unity</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - I had to write HTML/CSS here and there, to maintain a showcase site for a store and to make this personal website.">HTML/CSS</span>, 
    <span data-tooltip="Basic level - I worked with JavaScript to extend the functionality of the Bokeh visualization library.">JavaScript</span>
